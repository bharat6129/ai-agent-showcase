# Google ADK Agents

This directory contains examples of AI agents built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). These agents leverage Google's Generative AI capabilities and tools to perform specific tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup for Google ADK Examples

To run these examples, you will typically need:

1.  **A Google Cloud Project**: Ensure billing is enabled.
2.  **API Keys/Authentication**: Set up appropriate authentication methods (e.g., Application Default Credentials, service account keys, or API keys depending on the specific Google service used).
3.  **Environment Variables**: Many examples might rely on environment variables for API keys or project IDs (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID`).
4.  **Install dependencies**: Navigate to each example's subdirectory and install its specific `requirements.txt`.
