# AutoGen Agents

This directory showcases examples of multi-agent systems and conversational AI workflows built using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. AutoGen enables developers to build powerful applications by orchestrating conversations among multiple AI agents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup for AutoGen Examples

To run these examples, you will typically need:

1.  **LLM Provider API Key**: AutoGen heavily relies on Large Language Models. You'll likely need an API key from providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or others. Set this up as an environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
2.  **Install dependencies**: Navigate to each example's subdirectory and install its specific `requirements.txt`.

## üìÇ Examples

* [Conversational Assistant](./conversational-assistant/README.md): A basic setup demonstrating a simple multi-agent conversation.
* [Code Reviewer Team](./code-reviewer-team/README.md): An example of a team of agents collaborating to review code.
